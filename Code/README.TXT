This is an early digital prototype for Salvos.

It models the shipboard tactical movement phase though it’s very limited.

The player’s characters are represented by the Capsule shapes. You can select them by clicking on them or, once one is selected, by pressing TAB to toggle through them.

Once you have a character selected, you can click on an available action option (at this point “Move”) to move that characters.  Use the mouse to select the destination for movement.  The path that will be taken is shown by green arrows. If the destination can’t be reached (it’s too far away or inaccessible) , a red circle will be shown.

Clicking on the destination will cause the character to move to that destination following the path.

At this point the demo loops back to player selection after movement. There’s no limit on how often you can move each of the players.

You can cancel selection by hitting the ESC key at any point.
